"""Promotional/discount offers: a time-limited discounted offer on top of the already-live
base price (price_scaled.xlsx), on Google Play and/or App Store Connect.

Google Play: a monetization.subscriptions.basePlans.offers resource with a relativeDiscount
phase (percentage off whatever the base plan charges in each region), then activated. No
price computation needed - Google computes the resulting absolute price internally.

App Store Connect: Apple has no percentage-off concept, so for each country we take
Smart_Price_Native from price_scaled.xlsx, apply the discount, and resolve it to the
closest available subscriptionPricePoint (retrying in USD when Apple prices that territory
in USD, via the same resolve_price_point() apply.py's base price update uses). Per-territory
prices are sent as a JSON:API compound document: the "prices" relationship references
client-chosen ids wrapped as "${local-id}" (Apple's own 409 error dictates this exact
format - a plain id like "NOR" is rejected with ENTITY_ERROR.INCLUDED.INVALID_ID), and a
top-level "included" array supplies, for each id, a subscriptionPricePoint + territory
relationship. This shape was reverse-engineered from Apple's live error responses; it
isn't in Apple's published OpenAPI schema.

Apple's PATCH endpoint for this resource rejects the same payload shape its POST endpoint
accepts (also undocumented) - since only POST is proven to work, re-running with the same
offerCode deletes the existing offer and fully recreates it via POST, at the cost of a
brief window where the offer doesn't exist. find_existing_apple_offer() is exposed
separately so the caller can warn about this *before* committing to it. Apple also never
frees up a name/offerCode once used, even after deletion (undocumented) - a duplicate-
attribute 409 on the recreate POST is auto-retried with a "-<unix timestamp>" suffix
appended to both, rather than failing outright.
