"""Price scaling: cost-of-living data + live exchange rates -> a per-country price ladder.

Uses "Meal for 2 People, Mid-range Restaurant, Three-course" as the PPP anchor metric
(see data.py for why the constant behind it doesn't actually matter).

The original PriceScaler class did file-read + HTTP + computation inside __init__, so it
couldn't be constructed without hitting the network, and its two genuinely pure helpers
(smart-pricing rounding, VAT lookup) were instance methods that never touched `self`. Both
are now plain functions - `apply_smart_pricing` here, VAT resolution as
`PricingConfig.vat_rate` in config.py - so they're directly unit-testable, and the pipeline
stages (load / fetch rates / compute) are explicit steps the caller controls and can show
progress for, rather than one eager constructor.
